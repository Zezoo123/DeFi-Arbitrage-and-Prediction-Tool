 Started Development on project
 Created script for collecting data on the current prices of cryptos and get 30 days worth of data for price over time
 Started production of flask website to display data on the current prices of cryptos and get 30 days worth of data
 
 !! create an update current_prices function or modify the save_current_prices function to update the current
    df rather than create a new one and save a brand new one each time.
 !! look into creating graphs for the 30 days of data.

 !! Add a new api data.

14/10/2024
 Found my old Binance account and did all the verification to get api.
 Connected to binance api in python using the binance library.
 Collected current prices of cryptos from binance

15/10/2024
 Collected klines from binance api for multiple cryptocurrencies
 Started a database-implementation branch to explore efficent data storage

17/10/2024
 Fixed format of save files for binance data
 Got a working kline plot implementation
 Displayed the kline on the website for each interval and each cryptocurrency

 !! Improve template for index for kline pages
 !! Start researching about Machine Learning techniques for price prediction
 !! Look at what other data values / heuristics such as web scraping from twitter and sentiment analysis.

18/10/2024
 Started implementation of neural network
 Used LSTM model with 2 hidden layers
 Used the 5 previous inputs to predict the next close value.

04/11/2024
 Read paper (Prediction and interpretation of daily NFT and DeFi prices dynamics: Inspection through ensemble machine learning & XAI)
 Started implementing my model which GBR and RF, while trying isomap and umap transformations on the features

 !! explore my model and try other stuff
 !! Cross validation with gridsearch on isomap and umap hyperparamaters (optimization)
